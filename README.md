This makes JavaScript coding much easier.  Keep reading to learn how to use it.

# Step 1
Download the files and put all of them in your project folder.
# Step 2
In your index.html file put this code at the end of your body:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
```
# Step 3
In your main.js file use some of the available commands.  Some examples are: 
```javascript
log("Hello World"); // This logs "Hello World" to the console
write("Hi"); // This writes "Hi" to the DOM (basically puts "Hi" on the screen)
createbutton("Test", "id1", "alert", "Hello"); // This creates a button with the text "Test", the id of "id1", and displays an alert of "Hello" whenever the button is clicked
style("test", "color", "blue"); // This styles the element with the id "test" and turns its color blue
style("test", "textalign", "center"); // This aligns the text in the element with the id "test" to the center
doc("style"); // This displays documentation for the "style" function
```
