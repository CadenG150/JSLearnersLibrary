This makes JavaScript coding much easier.  Keep reading to learn how to use it.

# Step 1
Download the files and put all of them in your project folder.
# Step 2
In your index.html file put this code at the end of your body:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
```
# Step 3
In your main.js file use some of the available commands.  Some examples are: 
```javascript
log("Hello World");
write("Hi");
createbutton("Test", "id1", "alert", "Hello");
style("test", "color", "blue");
style("test", "textalign", "center");
style("id1", "textalign", "center");
doc("all");
```
